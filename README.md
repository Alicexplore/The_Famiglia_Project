# The_Famiglia_Project
Vegan Restaurant / React Application 🥬

## About this project

"The Faliglia Restaurant" is a react app that offers you the opportunity to travel to the Trappist system.
<br /><br />
With the help of an API, we have retrieved data about the seven planets in the system in order to obtain their orbital periods and atmospheric temperatures.
<br /><br />
We then sorted this data to offer you, using a drop-down list, the choice to select the desired orbital period and temperature yourself.
<br /><br />
Finally, by combining the data previously selected by you, the planets are displayed so that you can obtain more information about them and make your final choice.
<br /><br />
Bon voyage 👋🏻
<br /><br />
Postscript: This GitHub repository will be completely transformed in order to present you a new version that will display the TRAPPIST system in animation and offer you a whole new experience. 🚀
